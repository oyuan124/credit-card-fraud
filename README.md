# Credit Card Fraud Project

## Goal of this Project

- Practice building different machine learning models to detect fraud
- Understand how to evaluate different models and improve models

## Data Source

The data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Due to privacy issue, PCA was conducted on the dataset so we don't have the original features. The only original features we have are: **time**, **amount** and **flag**
that can indicate fraud or not.
